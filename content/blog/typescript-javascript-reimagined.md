# First things First

JavaScript is the world's third most common programming language today. It was created by Brendan Eich in about ten days. It might seem odd that the
previous two sentences not only exist, but go together...yet it is true! JavaScript runs seemingly everywhere and the applications written in this
language are only getting larger.

> <p/>JavaScript was originally intended for 100 to 1,000 lines of code. Now with regularity applications are 100,000 to 1,000,000 lines of code.

## "The Good Parts"

Douglas Crockford authored a book "JavaScript: The Good Parts", sadily it was a rather short book. If you're a JavaScript developer, knowing "the good parts"
is great - but knowing the limitations and shortcomings of a language is even more powerful. Sometimes it feels like JavaScript is a hammer and not every 
problem we're trying to solve is a nail. NodeJs is a great example of this in my opinion, but I digress... If you want a good laugh watch

### Mental Modal

I met a fellow technical public speaker who is a well respected JavaScript developer. He was arguing his hatred for TypeScript. I had two major takeaways 
from the debate that I think will stick with me for a while.

#### Point One

There was an analogy that kept being mentioned, something about how "we cannot all be Tour De France champions" and I agreed with that. That is why I think
that TypeScript is like "training wheels" for JavaScript developers. And that is not at all a bad thing. Just look at what you can do with "training wheels".

#### Point Two

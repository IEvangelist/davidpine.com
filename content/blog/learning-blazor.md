Just over a year ago, I set out on a journey to write a book in the middle of a global pandemic. I had no idea what I was doing. I truly enjoy helping others, thank you for this opportunity. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I enjoyed writing it.

As an experienced Blazor developer, I learned more about localization and testing from David Pine in 20 minutes of reading than I did in days of searching for similar insight online. Not only is Learning Blazor an educational piece, but it's also a great reference that I will return to when building future Blazor applications.

Learning Blazor is one of the most informative books I have ever read, and it makes you want to start developing with WebAssembly and C# right away. Learning Blazor uses a great storyline and practical real-world examples to explain a modern technology and how it can be combined with JavaScript and HTML. A must-read for every web developer.

# Story Time

This is my third year organizing MKE DOT NET, so I've been accumulating plenty of interesting stories. Last year I was fortunate enough to have convinced Scott Hanselman to be our keynote speaker. Yes, "the <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>" - arguably the worlds most influential person in the tech industry. I was his ride to and from the airport, and the conversations we had actually led to several key changes. As a result <a href="http://www.mkedotnet.com/" target="_blank">MKE DOT NET</a> will be even better than before!

Scott told me that had he looked at our lineup of speakers prior to agreeing to be our keynote, he would have declined. My mind immediately started racing with thoughts like "does he only want to speak with well-known speakers" or "is this too small of a conference for such a celebrity?". None of those thoughts were the least bit accurate. In fact, the reason was simple "we were not diverse enough". Honestly this was something that I didn't even think about.

Moreover...

No...He requested that I give him a guided tour. He wanted to see how the rooms were going to be layed out, he wanted to test equipment and ensure lighting and sound, connectivity, etc. We actually ended up reorganizing the entire layout of the keynote room as well as changing the number of projectors. His "perfectionist" side was shining through, and it was really resonating with the team. Clearly he has done this a few more times than we have!

One of his initial comments though was that the hotel looked and smelled like grandmas house. Having just taken a sip of water, I nearly spit it out of my mouth in laugher - finally someone said what we had all been thinking. This resulted in a change of venue for 2017 and years to come. We'll be at <a href="https://www.paysbig.com/" target="_blank">Potawatomi Hotel & Casino</a> this year, and the new joke will be that is smells like cigarette smoke instead.

## Embracing Diversity

The truth was simple. MKE DOT NET 2016 only had one woman speaker and ironically she was speaking about Diversity. We were ready to lick our wounds and rise above it. I'm so proud to be part of this change and happy to communicate that MKE DOT NET now takes an active approach to ensure for a more diverse speaker lineup.

This year, we started leveraging <a href="https://www.papercall.io" target="_blank">papercall.io</a> as our event management system. It allowed us to make the speaker voting anonymized, but you're probably wondering how that helps with diversity. It actually doesn't and that would be naive to assume so. What we did was invited <a href="https://twitter.com/AshleyPQPQP" target="_blank">Ashley Powell</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samsaha1/" target="_blank">Samrat Saha</a> (both MKE DOT NET speaker alumni) to join our technical committee. They were a major part of the entire process and helped with the CFP outreach efforts. We believe this led to more submissions from their networks, ultimately leading to a more diverse lineup.

Of the 24 sessions and including the keynote, we are proud to have eight women speakers this year! If you're a numbers person - that is an <strong>800% increase</strong> year-over-year, and we plan on doing even better as we evolve.

## Evolution

Stickies.io, Trello Boards, static website generator, thanks to all the teams, alumni past, present and future speakers, shout outs to specifics and everyone that I may not have called out - thank you. The community for making this possible, without them this simply wouldn't be.

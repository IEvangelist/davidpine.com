# Books

I wrote my first book for O'Reilly Media, over the course of a year, collaborating with some of the smartest people I know. It's titled ["Learning Blazor: Build Single-Page Apps with WebAssembly and C#"](https://bit.ly/learning-blazor). I'm beyond proud of what I accomplished, and I'm thrilled to share with the world.

I want share a bit of the writing process and experience, so that other's might benefit from the author's perspective. It all started when I was initially approached by an acquisition editor at O'Reilly, who encouraged me to submit a proposal for a book on Blazor. I was unfamiliar with the process and I'd never written a book before. They graciously guided through what was expected for the proposal, providing a template and examples of successful proposals from previous titles. Following several video calls, and going back and forth a bit on the proposal, O'Reilly had enough to wager on. They decided they like what I was proposing enough to start negotiations for a contract.

One thing I wasn't willing to negotiate on was when I was going to start writing the book. They wanted me to start sooner than I was able to, but I stood my ground, and for good reason. I really wanted to have an application written that could serve as the basis for the book. I wanted my book to show something a bit more impactful, and a complete feature-rich application. I told I'd write it in a month. Truth be told, like all production-ready applications, I've been working on it ever since.

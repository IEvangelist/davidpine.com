I love being able to give back to the community and I enjoy how gratifying it can be. Public speaking on technologies
that I love or on professional skills development is just one of the ways I give back. Anytime that I get to express myself and share my passions - I'm absolutely thrilled. Here is where I have been and where I'm going to be, I hope to see you there!

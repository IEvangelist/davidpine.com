# Define yourself
You may have noticed my tag, **IEvangelist**. If you see this as an interface it would look something like the following 
(I'd be more or less a placeholder interface, but I'd impose many other contracts).
```csharp
interface IEvangelist : IAcceptFailure,
                        IAdapt,
                        IAdvocate,
                        IAssure,
                        IContribute,
                        ICritize,
                        IEvaluate,
                        IExceed,
                        IGetBackUp,
                        IGrow,
                        IInspirable,
                        IInspire,                        
                        ILead,
                        ILearn,
                        ILeverage,
                        IListen,                            
                        IMentor,
                        IMetaAF,
                        IModerate,
                        IMotivatable,
                        IMotivate,
                        INeverGiveUp,
                        IPassionate,
                        IProsper,
                        IRemainPositive,
                        IShare,
                        ISucceed,
                        IPerson
{
    // An evangelist is ... write your own implementation
}
```
<hr/>
It all started with my middle school ambition - I wanted to learn how those cool FPS games worked. I loved Wolfenstein, Quake, Doom, Duke Nukem, Half-Life, etc...and I just wanted to learn how they ticked, take a look under the hood. I taught myself how to use <a href="http://quark.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">QuArK (Quake Army Knife)</a> and <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor" target="_blank">Valve Hammer</a>, harnessing my passions for art and three-dimensional space. I found myself building elaborate architectures, painstakingly applying textures, dissecting the best placement for a light source that will cast desirable shadows - drawing attention to focal points, etc. I loved building these maps more than I loved playing them. Rendering thousands of polygons and entities down into a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning" target="_blank">binary space partition (.bsp)</a>, something about that was gratifying.

I then had an idea of what I wanted to do. Years later, I decided that I wanted to be a software engineer and that is what I set out to become. I like to think of myself as being a charismatic, results-driven software engineer with proficiency in adaptability and problem solving. Experienced in .NET frameworks, team software engineering and agile development methodologies.

## What people are saying

> <p/> You are a beacon of light in a grumpy world of developers. Your excitement is infectious. I'm so blessed to know you!

<br/>

> <p/> So David Pine, you are about to embark on your first international speaking engagement.  Congratulations, good luck and know that wherever you go, all of us here will be wishing you well.  We know they are getting not just a speaker, but someone who represents the best of our developer community values here in the upper Midwest, someone who is eager to share what he knows with others, someone who is generous with his time and patient in his approach.  You represent the best of us because you are so invested in the success of others.  I couldn't think of a better person they could have asked to come and speak and certainly not one more deserving.  You will do an amazing job, and when you get back, we'll have a Spotted Cow, a Brat and some Chicago deep dish pizza waiting for you.

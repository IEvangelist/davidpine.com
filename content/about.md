# Define yourself
You may have noticed my tag, **IEvangelist**. If you see this as an interface it would look something like the following 
(I'd be more or less a placeholder interface, but I'd impose many other contracts).
```csharp
interface IEvangelist : IAcceptFailure,
                        IAdapt,
                        IAdvocate,
                        IAssure,
                        IContribute,
                        ICritize,
                        IEvaluate,
                        IExceed,
                        IGetBackUp,
                        IGrow,
                        IInspirable,
                        IInspire,                        
                        ILead,
                        ILearn,
                        ILeverage,
                        IListen,                            
                        IMentor,
                        IMetaAF,
                        IModerate,
                        IMotivatable,
                        IMotivate,
                        INeverGiveUp,
                        IPassionate,
                        IProsper,
                        IRemainPositive,
                        IShare,
                        ISucceed,
                        IPerson
{
    // An evangelist is ... write your own implementation
}
```
<hr/>
It all started with my middle school ambition - I wanted to learn how those cool FPS games worked. I loved Wolfenstein, Quake, Doom, Duke Nukem, Half-Life, etc...and I just wanted to learn how they ticked, take a look under the hood. I taught myself how to use <a href="http://quark.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">QuArK (Quake Army Knife)</a> and <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor" target="_blank">Valve Hammer</a>, harnessing my passions for art and three-dimensional space. I found myself building elaborate architectures, painstakingly applying textures, dissecting the best placement for a light source that will cast desirable shadows - drawing attention to focal points, etc. I loved building these maps more than I loved playing them. Rendering thousands of polygons and entities down into a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning" target="_blank">binary space partition (.bsp)</a>, something about that was gratifying.

I then had an idea of what I wanted to do. Years later, I decided that I wanted to be a software engineer and that is what I set out to become. I like to think of myself as being a charismatic, results-driven software engineer with proficiency in adaptability and problem solving. Experienced in .NET frameworks, team software engineering and agile development methodologies.

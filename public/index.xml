      <description>Intro With more than 40 million active users, GitHub is by far the largest source code hosting platform in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s an open source developers dream, and ecosystem and developer community unlike any other. And with all these users and such profound openness, there&amp;rsquo;s bound to be frustration from time-to-time. In this post we will explore an Azure Function written with ASP.NET Core 3.0 and C# 8.0. It has been designed to handle a GitHub webhook for issues and pull requests.</description>

      <description>Background Most of us are all &amp;ldquo;slackers&amp;rdquo;, meaning we truly do spend a significant amount of time using  Slack.
  Slack is a collaboration hub for work, no matter what work you do. Itâ€™s a place where conversations happen, decisions are made, and information is always at your fingertips. www.slack.com
 It&amp;rsquo;s wildly popular in the Developer Community! In fact, almost to a fault&amp;hellip;people are constantly sharing their &amp;ldquo;slack fatigue&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The Story Behind The Game I have three sons. Lyric who is six and a half, Londyn who is four and half, and Lennyx who is two and half. As you might imagine, they seldom agree on things. For example when it&amp;rsquo;s family move night, &amp;ldquo;which movie we&amp;rsquo;ll watch?&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;who gets to go first?&amp;rdquo; when playing a game. These important life decisions are often decided by playing the color guessing game.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud to share that this post is part of the C# Advent Calendar and it&amp;rsquo;s my second year contributing to it! I encourage you to check out all the others here.
 
Developers Are Lazy! In the world of web development it is hard to escape certain tools that we are forced to rely on. As developers we&amp;rsquo;re innately lazy and it is safe to say that perhaps we don&amp;rsquo;t really care enough to look into other tooling options.</description>

      <description>I recently decided to give creating videos a test drive. The problem with creating video content is the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s really time consuming to do, but the time investment can be worth the effort if you&amp;rsquo;re able to truly deliver some sort of value. Another problem we&amp;rsquo;re faced with in the technical community is that videos can be very lengthy. Enter DMP in 3, a video series of 3 minute videos.</description>

      <description>Every time a developer encounters a new technology it&amp;rsquo;s in our nature to explore it. This is the case with WebAssembly, and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s vision of the world in Blazor. Blazor is single page application framework that sits atop of WebAssembly, but it&amp;rsquo;s still considered an experiment. I had the chance to interview Steve Sanderson about WebAssembly and Blazor &amp;ndash; I shared that post earlier this month. Now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore Blazor with you a bit more.</description>

      <description>I set out a while ago to try to interview various community leaders for their take on WebAssembly. If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with WebAssembly, here&amp;rsquo;s a definition for you.
  WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine webassembly.org
  That&amp;rsquo;s a lot to try to parse, right?! I was able to get an interview with Steve Sanderson, which I&amp;rsquo;m going to share in this post.</description>

      <description>Intro I love working with the Angular HttpClient. It is easy to use and was designed to work with RxJS. It is vastly different from the AngularJS implementation, if you&amp;rsquo;re curious I wrote about these differences here. However, there is one common issue that developers fall victim to. The issue really relates to TypeScript generics. I have also written about generics in TypeScript here. But in this post, we will reveal how the issue can easily be avoided.</description>

      <description>Inspiration I recently returned from Charleston, South Carolina &amp;ndash; where I spoke at SyntaxCon. The event was very professionally organized and gave me inspiration for Cream City Code. In the main hall they had a HALO by Simple Booth. It serves as a photo booth with a conference specific backdrop &amp;ndash; which is perfect for sharing the conference experience. I looked into purchasing one but was encouraged to simply write my own&amp;hellip; so I did and this blog will detail that process.</description>

      <description>Intro I am returning home from a long trip in Serbia for IT Konekt. This was literally a trip of a lifetime and I could not be more grateful for such an amazing opportunity. Serbia has such an incredible culture and powerful history. I have been overwhelmed by the care and attention to detail from the organizers of IT Konekt. This was my first time ever leaving the United States of America and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect.</description>

      <description>Intro As a developer, I can say that developers are lazy - at least I know and acknowledge that I am. If I&amp;rsquo;m tasked with something even the slightest bit repetitious I&amp;rsquo;ll script it out, or find a way to automate it. Likewise, if I fall into a habit of forgetting something important - I&amp;rsquo;ll figure out a way to not forget. Especially when it comes to securing an application.</description>

I counted 99 *.xproj and project.json based projects spanning four repositories that need to be updated to the revitalized *.csproj project format. With this the team can upgrade to the latest version of Visual Studio (finally upgrading to 2017 from 2015) and start taking advantage of the following:</description>

      <description>Intro Monday, August 14th was an amazing day to be a .NET developer! As the world celebrates another triumphant series of announcements from Microsoft, there is still confusion amongst the masses.
  What is this .NET Standard thing?  What does it mean to target .NET Standard versus .NET Core, or even the .NET Framework?  As a developer, what .NET should I target and why?  Are Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) dead?</description>

      <description>First things First JavaScript is the world&amp;rsquo;s third most common programming language today. JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in about ten days. It might seem odd that the previous two sentences not only exist, but go together&amp;hellip;yet it is true! JavaScript runs seemingly everywhere and applications written in this language are only getting larger.
  JavaScript was perhaps intended for 100, maybe up to 1,000 lines of code and now with regularity people are building 100,000 line apps, if not 1,000,000 line apps.</description>

This post contains examples and details on five of the nine new C# 7 features.
 Pattern matching out variables Tuples Local functions throw expressions  These are the remaining features, that I do not cover in this post.</description>

      <description>Overview In .NET it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to create your own interfaces and implementations. Likewise, it&amp;rsquo;s seemingly effortless to register them for dependency injection. But it is not always obvious how to override existing implementations. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss various aspects of &amp;ldquo;dependency injection&amp;rdquo; and how you can override the &amp;ldquo;framework-provided services&amp;rdquo;.
As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s take a recent story on our product backlog for building a security audit of login attempts. The story involved the capture of attempted usernames along with their corresponding IP addresses.</description>

      <description>Life   Like an aggressive contagion seeking the next victim, negativity can plague an entire team&amp;rsquo;s morale. Negativity is contagious!
 Optimism is a choice   Expect nothing, but be grateful for everything.
 Programming   In programming there isn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;right way&amp;rdquo; but there is always a &amp;ldquo;wrong way&amp;rdquo;. There is however a &amp;ldquo;better way&amp;rdquo;, until you run out of time.

This is not the IPrincipal you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss what happened and what you need to do now. Additionally we&amp;rsquo;ll cover all the peripheral benefits as a result of this change.

      <description>What is &amp;ldquo;impostor syndrome&amp;rdquo; you ask?
According to Wikipedia:
 Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome) is a term coined in 1978 by clinical psychologists Dr. Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes referring to high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a &amp;ldquo;fraud&amp;rdquo;. Despite external evidence of their competence, those exhibiting the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved.</description>

      <description>Intro Monday, August 14th was an amazing day to be a .NET developer! As the world celebrates another triumphant series of announcements from Microsoft, there is still confusion amongst the masses.
  What is this .NET Standard thing?  What does it mean to target .NET Standard versus .NET Core, or even the .NET Framework?  As a developer, what .NET should I target and why?  Are Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) dead?</description>

      <title>Overriding ASP.NET Core Framework-Provided Services</title>

      <description>Overview In .NET it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to create your own interfaces and implementations. Likewise, it&amp;rsquo;s seemingly effortless to register them for dependency injection. But it is not always obvious how to override existing implementations. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss various aspects of &amp;ldquo;dependency injection&amp;rdquo; and how you can override the &amp;ldquo;framework-provided services&amp;rdquo;.
As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s take a recent story on our product backlog for building a security audit of login attempts. The story involved the capture of attempted usernames along with their corresponding IP addresses.</description>

      <description>Overview Like the title claims, if you&amp;rsquo;re using ASP.NET Core and expecting the Thread.CurrentPrincipal or ClaimsPrincipal.Current to be populated you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong. This is not the IPrincipal you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss what happened and what you need to do now. Additionally we&amp;rsquo;ll cover all the peripheral benefits as a result of this change.
History If you have ever done any .NET Framework development, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen the Thread class.</description>

      <description>Inspiration I am certainly not the first one to create a magic mirror, and I will not be the last either. I was inspired by those who are true Innovators&amp;hellip;some might say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m standing on the shoulders of giants&amp;rdquo;. They would probably we right, and I&amp;rsquo;m okay with that. Earlier this year, I stumbled upon a tweet about someone how created a magic mirror&amp;hellip;this is the root of my inspiration.</description>
